I think on this project I misunderstood goal. What I did was create a 10 spot array. For each position in the array a random number of 1-10 is generated.
If that position is a 3 then a 1 is added to that same postion in the array. So, after 1000 numbers run in each array position, the user will see the total amount of 
3s that fell in each position.

This project was a Cash Calculator. It prompts for a number of customers and the price of a product that they purchased. Once all customers have been entered
the program will calculate the maximum cash spent, the minimum cash spent, the total cash spent, and the average cash spent. All of this is displayed in a simple 
summary at the end.
